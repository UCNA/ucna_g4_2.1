Things to check when you want to run a simulation.

	1) Get PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc and change the INPUT_PTCL_FILE to be
	the name of the particle file that you're using.

	2) In PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc and EventAction.cc change the OUTPUT_FILE
	name to be the same thing for both files!

	3) In UCN/EventGenTools/ run MC_EventGen.cc to create the initial particle
	kinematics file. Make sure it's stored in the /G4Sim... folder.
