NOTE: need to run in UCNA_BASE directory.

1) need to run setup-geant.sh to set all GEANT4 environment variables.
Type either
. setup-geant.sh OR source setup-geant.sh

(Optional) Run install-geant.sh to install GEANT4.
./install-geant.sh

2) Next use build-ucna.
./build-ucna

3) Can ignore the install-ucna since it is old stuff.
